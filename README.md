# Urban Green Analysis
This project aligns with SDG-15 (Life on Land) by using remote sensing to analyze urbanization's impact on vegetation cover in Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities. It tracks changes in green spaces and built-up areas, providing insights for biodiversity conservation, sustainable urban planning, and climate resilience. The goal is to contribute to a balance between development and environmental sustainability.

**Objectives**

•	To utilize satellite remote sensing data to assess green spaces in urban areas.
•	To calculate ratios and elasticities based on built-up and vegetation classes.
•	To evaluate urban greenery dynamics and determine growth percentages for various cities.
•	To contribute to sustainable urban planning by providing insights into urban development trends.

**Methodology**

•	Data collected from satellite imagery and processed using remote sensing techniques.
•	Classified data into built-up and vegetation categories, and performed statistical analysis for growth, ratio, and elasticity.
•	Assessed how urbanization affects green spaces and ecological balance.

**Key Findings**

•	The study analyzed and measured the expansion patterns of vegetation in targeted cities.
•	Percentage changes across cities were calculated, offering a clearer picture of urbanization impacts.
•	The research emphasized the value of green zones in reducing heat island effects and boosting climate adaptability.

**Contributions**

•	**Biodiversity Preservation** : Strategies to protect natural areas amid urban growth.
•	**Urban Green Zones** : Assessment of the current condition and progress of greenery in metropolitan regions.
•	**Eco-friendly Development** : Suggestions for embedding natural spaces in urban design.
•	**Climate Adaptation** : Examination of how green areas contribute to countering climate challenges.

**Limitations**

•	**Satellite Resolution Limitation** : Low satellite resolution affects data accuracy in urban areas.
•	**Seasonal Variability** : Seasonal changes impact satellite data accuracy and consistency.
•	**Data Processing Challenges** : Technical issues may reduce the reliability of processed data.
•	**Classification Accuracy** : Misclassification risks increase in complex mixed land-use areas.
•	**Limited Ground Truth Data** : Insufficient ground data limits validation and increases uncertainty.

**Future Scope**

•	Apply machine learning models to automate and enhance feature classification and detection.
•	Incorporate additional environmental parameters such as weather patterns, water bodies, and biodiversity.
•	Use AI-driven image enhancement for clearer, more accurate insights and real-time satellite data to monitor changes dynamically.
•	Expand the study to track long-term environmental impacts and propose actionable green policies for urban planners.
